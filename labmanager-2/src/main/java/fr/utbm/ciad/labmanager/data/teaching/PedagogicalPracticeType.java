	 *     the school hierarchy.</li>
	 * <li>The permanence of learning: Based on a study which proves that the student learns better when he
	 *     acts, the students make the corrections of his exercises, create lessons and carry out an overall
	 *     assessment at the end.</li>
	 * <li>Creativity: Students can choose the tools they want to learn and transmit the content of the course,
