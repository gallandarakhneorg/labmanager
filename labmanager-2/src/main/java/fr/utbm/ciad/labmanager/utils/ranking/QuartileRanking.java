/** Quartile is one indicator for ranking scientific journals.
 * A quartile is the ranking of a journal or paper definite by any database based

 * It can divide into four different quadrants starting with Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.
 * 
 * <p>Two major sources of ranking may be used:<ul>
 * <li>Scimajo Journal Ranking</li>
 * <li>Journal Citatio Reports of Web-of-Science</li>
