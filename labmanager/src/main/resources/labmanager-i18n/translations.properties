realization of a finished product.
pedagogicalPracticeType.DISTANCE_LEARNING = Distance learning
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.DISTANCE_LEARNING = The students are located remotely to the teacher. The main types of distance learning are: (i) MOOCs - this is a chaptered course open to any \
Internet user. Often spread over several weeks, embellished with remote group work, online chat, quizzes, it allows everyone to learn about a subject and benefit from knowledge on a theme; (ii) SPOCs - \
online chapter courses, often spread over several sessions, on the same principle as MOOCs. On the other hand, the audience is limited to a group of users defined upstream (about thirty for example); \
COOCs (for Corporate Open Online Course): this is online training used within the company to train employees; ; (iii) SOOC (for Social Open Online Course) - this is an online training whose objective \
is to increase interactions between course participants. To do this, SOOCs are enhanced with collaborative tools (e.g. forum, content creation tools such as wiki, blog, etc.).

pedagogicalPracticeType.description.HISTORICAL_METHOD = Practices are based on the historical method with lectures, tutorials and lab works.
pedagogicalPracticeType.INVERTED_CLASSROOM = Inverted classroom
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.INVERTED_CLASSROOM = The inverted classroom consists in providing students, before the course, with documents so that they can work on the theory themselves and once in \
class, they can apply their knowledge thus acquired to concrete situations that are proposed to them. The Professor no longer ensures the presentation of the rules but, by supervising the students, he will \
nevertheless have the opportunity to explain these rules and to give examples of their application.
pedagogicalPracticeType.MODERN_PRESENTATION_TOOLS = Use of modern presentation tools
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.MODERN_PRESENTATION_TOOLS = Many tools allow you to modernize a course. They come in the form of presentation tools such as PowerPoint, diagrams, videos. Their strengths \

his actions, a monetary and political system is put in place. Every decision is made democratically so that the students are directly involved. They are endowed with a responsibility in the classroom, thus taking \
a position in the school hierarchy; (ii) The permanence of learning - Based on a study which proves that the student learns better when he acts, the students make the corrections of his exercises, create lessons \
and carry out an overall assessment at the end; (iii) Creativity - Students can choose the tools they want to learn and transmit the content of the course, promoting the sharing of knowledge with peers in a fun way.
pedagogicalPracticeType.PROBLEM_BASED_LEARNING = Problem based learning
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.PROBLEM_BASED_LEARNING = Problem-Based Learning (or PBL) takes a socio-constructivist approach to learning. It is a question of immersing the learner in the subject through a \
problem to be solved in a few hours (or a project to be carried out over several days, even several months). This leads him to seek information to develop a solution, knowing that the concepts are not previously \
taught to students.
pedagogicalPracticeType.PROJECT_ORIENTED = Project-oriented pedagogy
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.PROJECT_ORIENTED = Pedagogy in project mode encourages people to put knowledge into practice through collective work on a given problem.
pedagogicalPracticeType.REVERSE_CLASS = Reverse class
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.REVERSE_CLASS = The reverse class consists of completely reversing the roles between teacher and learner. Thus the learners build the course, the knowledge checks thus taking \
the place of the teacher while it is the teacher who will be noted, checked by the learners. During the time of the lessons, the learners build the lessons together in groups, share them, confront them and the \
teacher plays the role of coach, orients them, guides them, challenges them. Learners are graded with regard to their skills, to organize themselves, to think, to build in a given time, as within a company.
pedagogicalPracticeType.SERIOUS_GAME = Serious game
pedagogicalPracticeType.description.SERIOUS_GAME = The game is used here as a pedagogical spring, but to lead to serious learning. Some of these games are diverted from their initial playful use. Furthermore, \
