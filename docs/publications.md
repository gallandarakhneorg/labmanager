### 4.1 Common fields for the publications

## 5. Add publications from BibTeX

Because entering publications one by one manually is a long task it is possible to import a group of publications by providing a BibTeX file.

To have information on this feature, go to [the dedicated document](importbibtex.md).

## 6. Regenerate thumbnails for publications

The publications may be associated to a PDF file for the publication and a PDF file for any certificate associated to this publication (see Section 4.1).

To make the system efficient, JPEG pictures are generated from the PDF files to be displayed on the web pages.

For forcing the generation of these PDF pictures, you could use the 
feature `Regenerate thumbnails` and wait for a while.
